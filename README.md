The program's principal orchestrator and functional centre is the ReportCardSystem class. The application's entry point engages the user and reads input for the group number, student name, and module scores. It generates a new student object using the Student class and sets the pertinent characteristics, including name, group number, module, and scores, using the proper getter and setter methods.
Additionally, the Module class, a utility class that offers a static method called getModuleByGroup, interacts with the ReportCardSystem class. The supplied group number is mapped using this manner to the name of the associated module (engineering, biology, or business). The ReportCardSystem may choose the proper module based on the user's input thanks to its interaction with the Module class.
